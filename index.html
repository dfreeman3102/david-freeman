                    This is my CSS cheat sheet, the purpose of this website is to assist me in the different elements of CSS. If you hover over the h1 it 
                    gives a description of how to use the site.

                At this point in time I only have the one project to put on this website but I will be adding more quantity and better quality

        <p id="about-desc">
            I'm David Freeman. Currently I am employed at Innospec Active Chemicals,
            as a forklift certified warehouse operator during the day, and at night I am working diligently to achieve
            my goal of becoming a great Software Engineer. Since June of 2023, I have been studying coding languages such as HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript and I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through UNC Chapel Hill. I will be furthering 
            my knowledge in the previously mentioned languages and learning about frameworks and additional languages too, so one day
            I can work full-time as a Dev and continue to learn as much as I can about coding. Thank you for learning about me and see my contacts down below.
